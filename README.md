# Design Systems Demo

This repo is designed to supplement [The Beauty of Design Systems Conference Talk](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W6oxMmlWcpyLE1zZOY47DL2kcZkHF9wDBfsvkzO3jog/edit?usp=sharing).

In `/src/components/RecommendedSection` and `/src/components/RecommendedSection`, you will find two different implementations of a card list. The two components have slightly different styling, responsiveness, and accessibility. They are used in the `App.tsx` file.

The purpose of this demo is to replace these disjointed components with a single, reusable component that relies on the [Gamut](https://gamut.codecademy.com/) design system.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
